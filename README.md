# zomato-case-study-sql
# Overview of the Zomato SQL Project:
      This project is a Restaurant Management Database System modeled similar to Zomato, designed using MySQL. It involves multiple related tables to store and      manage data about restaurants, customers, orders, menu items, and reviews. The system allows users to efficiently handle restaurant operations and extract meaningful insights through SQL queries.

    T 1.he database captures essential business information such as:
    
      2. Restaurant details (name, city, cuisine, rating)
    
      3. Customer information (name, contact, city)
    
      4. Orders (which customer ordered what, order amount, status)
    
      5. Menu items (dish name, type, price)

      6. Customer reviews and ratings
 # Objective of the Zomato SQL Project:

    The main objective of this project is to design and implement a relational database system for a restaurant management scenario similar to Zomato. It aims to:
    
    Store and manage restaurant data – including details like name, city, cuisine, and ratings.
    
    Manage customer information – keeping track of customer profiles, contact details, and city.
    
    Track orders – record which customer ordered from which restaurant, along with order amount, date, and status.
    
    Manage menu items – store information about dishes offered by each restaurant, including type and price.
    
    Capture reviews and ratings – enable storing customer feedback and ratings for restaurants.
    
    Perform data analysis – allow running SQL queries to extract insights, like top-rated restaurants, total revenue, popular cuisines, or customer behavior.

# Tools Used in the Zomato SQL Project:
    MySQL / MySQL Workbench – for creating the database, tables, and executing SQL queries.
    
    SQL – the primary language used for database creation, data manipulation, and data retrieval.
    
    Text Editor / IDE – such as VS Code or Sublime Text for writing SQL scripts.
    
    GitHub – for version control and showcasing the project.
    Demonstrate database concepts – including table relationships, primary and foreign keys, aggregation, grouping, filtering, and ordering.
